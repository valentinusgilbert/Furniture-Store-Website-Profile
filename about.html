            <h2>Our Journey</h2>
            <p>Founded by Valentinus Gilbert as a teenager in the 1930's which started as a hobby of making furniture for his own home. Then many of his relatives were interested and then he opened a Furnid furniture store in 1950, until it grew to what it is now.</p>

            <h2>We Love Earth</h2>
            <p>Every tree we cut down to make furniture, we replant it with new lips, so that the forest ecosystem is not chaotic, so that the earth is always green. Because forests are the lungs of the world that produce oxygen for humans to breathe.</p>
